# 8 - Input

It's time to have the bird jump when we click (or tap) the screen!

Sprite methods like `loop` have a `getInputs` parameter which returns an object of what inputs are being pressed in the current frame. We want to access `inputs.pointer` which has information about the mouse (or touch on mobile).

When the `pointer` has just been pressed (which only happens for one frame) we return a different value of the `birdGravity` state to update gravity, thus giving our bird a jump upwards. Give it a try!
