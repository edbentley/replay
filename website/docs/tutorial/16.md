# 16 - Score

Let's add a score to count how many pipes the bird managed to fly past.

In the `Level` Sprite we add a `score` field to the state and increment it whenever we pass a pipe. Then we render it in the top-left corner with a `t.text` Texture.

Notice the `align` prop on the text Texture: by default, Sprites have an anchor point in their center, which defines how they're positioned and rotate. Setting `align: "left"` moves the left edge of the text to the Sprite's anchor point, providing a left text align for the score. The `x` position of the Texture is now the left side of it, not the center.
