# 1 - Intro

Welcome to the Replay tutorial!

We're going to explore how to build games with Replay by building _Replay Bird_. You can try playing it yourself on the right. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be equipped with all the knowledge you need to go out and make your own games using Replay.

If you'd like to follow along, you can clone the replay-starter GitHub project in [TypeScript](https://github.com/edbentley/replay-starter-ts) or [JavaScript](https://github.com/edbentley/replay-starter-js). Once complete, we can play it in the browser and on iOS!

Alternatively, you can develop online using CodeSandbox in [TypeScript](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/edbentley/replay-starter-ts) or [JavaScript](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/edbentley/replay-starter-js).
