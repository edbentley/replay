# 13 - Main Menu

Let's now create a menu to unpause our game so we can actually play it again!

We create a `Menu` Sprite like we did before, the only new thing here being the `t.text` Texture Replay provides to draw text to the screen. We can set a different message for different types of devices by checking the `device.isTouchScreen` field.

In our top-level `Game` Sprite we can render the `Menu` Sprite on top of the `Level` Sprite. But when we're playing the game, we return `null` to hide it.

Notice how `Menu` takes a _callback_ prop `start`. By passing a function as a prop, we can use `updateState` in the `render` method to update the `Game` Sprite's state. `updateState` is a function which takes the existing state and returns a new state to render on the next frame.

This pattern is how child Sprites can update their parent's state, while still keeping a one-way data flow. In doing so, `Game` is always in control of how its own state changes.
