# 6 - State

Our game isn't very interesting right now, we need the bird to move! To do this we'll create a Sprite with _state_.

In a new file `level` let's add a Sprite called `Level`, which will hold most of our game logic.

The `Level` Sprite has an `init` method which returns our initial state. We then access our `state` in the `render` method.

To set the bird's position, we can add an `x` and `y` coordinate `prop` to the `Bird` Sprite. All Sprites (including Textures) take an `x` and `y` prop.

In our top-level `Game` Sprite we should also import the `Level` Sprite instead of the `Bird` Sprite.
