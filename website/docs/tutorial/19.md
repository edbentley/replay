# 19 - Audio

The only thing our game is missing now is some sound! Let's play the boop sound that replay-starter comes with whenever the bird hits a pipe.

The `device` parameter has an `audio` method, which takes a file name and returns a sound object. We can then call `play()` on it to play a sound.

Lastly we need to ensure the audio file is being loaded in our `Game` Sprite.
