# 22 - Play on iOS

As a last step, we'll try running the game on an iOS device. For this you'll need to have Xcode installed.

First we need to export our `options` from the `src/index` file so that it can be picked up by the Swift version of Replay too, as shown on the right.

Next open Xcode (`open swift/*.xcodeproj`) and make sure the `bird.png` and `boop.wav` files have been dragged into the project.

Whenever you build or run the project, the command `npm run build-swift` is automatically called - this will create a single JavaScript file `game.js` using webpack.

Finally run the game!
