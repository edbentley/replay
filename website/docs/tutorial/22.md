# 22 - Play on iOS

As a last step, we'll try running the game on an iOS device. For this you'll need to have Xcode installed.

First we need to export our `options` from the `src/index` file so that it can be picked up by the Swift version of Replay too, as shown on the right.

Then we need to create a single JavaScript file of the game using webpack, by running on the command line:

```bash
npm run build-swift
```

Any time you update your game, you'll need to rerun this command to test it out on an iOS device.

Next open Xcode (`open swift/*.xcodeproj`) and make sure the `bird.png` and `boop.wav` files have been dragged into the project.

Finally run the game!
