# 21 - Gameplay Test

Let's expand our test to play the game. We're going to check the bird can fly past 2 pipes, then crash into one, ending up with a score of `2`.

We pass an `initRandom` field into `testSprite`. This ensures `device.random()` calls always produce the same result, in this case `0.5`, then `0.5`, then `0`. With this we can ensure our bird knows what height to fly at.

We create a function `keepBirdInMiddle` which is going to keep clicking the screen when the bird's `y` position is too low, to keep the bird jumping at the right height.

We can access the bird Texture through the `getTexture("bird")` call in order to read its `y` value. Here `"bird"` is the `testId` `prop` which we need to pass into the `t.image` Texture in our `Bird` Sprite. The `testId` prop can be passed into any Texture to reference it in a test.

We loop through the game's frames with `jumpToFrame`, which will keep running until a condition returns either a Texture or `true`. When that exits (bird hit a pipe!) we confirm the score shows as expected.

Lastly we can even confirm the sound effect played as expected after we crashed.
