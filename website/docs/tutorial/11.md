# 11 - Rotation

The `position` prop also accepts a `rotation` field, which we can use to improve the visuals of the bird flapping.

The rotation is given in degrees (positive clockwise) and rotates about the _anchor point_ of a Sprite - the anchor point is by default the center point of the Sprite.

Here we can setup the rotation as a little function of the current gravity - a negative rotation to face upwards when moving upwards, and a positive rotation to face downwards when moving downwards.
