# 4 - Game Props

Below the `Game` are the `gameProps`. We don't apply them now, but when we run the game on web or iOS, we'll import the `Game` and its `gameProps` and apply them like `Game(gameProps)`.

You can see an example of this in the `web/index` file, where we call the `renderCanvas` function from the `@replay/web` package to render our game in the browser.

`gameProps` requires an `id` for the `Game` Sprite and the `size` of our game, which we'll discuss next. We also add an _optional_ `defaultFont` `prop` to set the default font size and keep a consistent font family for any text we render later on.
