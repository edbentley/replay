# 9 - Keyboard

We can also support pressing the space bar to jump for players using a keyboard through a browser.

To do this we can look at the `inputs.keysJustPressed` object to see if the space key was just pressed.

The fields `inputs.keysDown` and `inputs.keysJustPressed` contain an object which will have a `true` value for any key codes pressed. Check out [keycode.info](https://keycode.info) for possible `key` values.
