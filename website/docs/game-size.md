Since Replay can deploy to multiple platforms, you likely want your game to work at various dimensions, sizes and orientations. Replay has a few tools to make this easier for you.

## Game Coordinates

Your game must have a fixed `width` and `height`. This is unitless, not in pixels! You can choose any values you like. When you set the `position` of a sprite, you are setting it relative to your width and height. **The origin (0,0) is in the center of the screen, and the y axis is positive upwards.**

## Safe Zone

Your game can also set a margin beyond the fixed `width` and `height` to avoid black bars on resolutions that don't match your game's dimensions. Inside the margins is the _safe zone_ where you should render the important visuals in the game. In the margins you can put non-essential visuals like wider backgrounds. Alternatively, you can calculate the total width and height of the device in your `render` method and position responsively.

## Orientations

Sprites have multiple `render` methods to deal with different orientations and resolutions, as mentioned in [Sprites](sprites.md). Only **one** `render` method will be chosen based on your settings. You don't need to set them for every Sprite, if they're not present Replay will default to using just `render`.

## `size` Game Prop

Your [Top-Level Game](top-level-game.md) Sprite accepts a `size` prop:

```js
Game({
  id: "Game",
  size: {
    width: 500,
    height: 300,
    minWidthXL: 1000,
    minHeightXL: 500,
    maxWidthMargin: 100,
    maxHeightMargin: 100,
  },
})
```

`size` takes the following fields:

- `width`: The width of your game, defines the `x` game coordinates.
- `height`: The height of your game, defines the `y` game coordinates.
- `minWidthXL`: (Optional) Set this if you want to use the `renderXL` methods when the device's width is beyond this value in pixels.
- `minHeightXL`: (Optional) Set this if you want to use the `renderXL` methods when the device's height is beyond this value in pixels.
- `maxWidthMargin`: (Optional) Set to allow a margin on the left and right of game in game coordinates (up to this value).
- `maxHeightMargin`: (Optional) Set to allow a margin on the top and bottom of game in game coordinates (up to this value).

The example above is for a landscape-only game. If you want portrait-only simply set a height greater than the width.

If you want to support both landscape and portrait, `size` can accept an object with `portrait` and `landscape` fields like below. The orientation is chosen by Replay automatically.

```js
Game({
  id: "Game",
  size: {
    portrait: {
      width: 300,
      height: 500,
      ...
    },
    landscape: {
      width: 500,
      height: 300,
      ...
    }
  }
})
```

If the screen is landscape, Replay will call `render` and `renderXL` (if defined). If it's in portrait, Replay will call `renderP` or `renderPXL` if they're defined instead.

## `device.size`

The `size` field in the `device` parameter of the Sprite methods contains properties you can use for layout:

```js
const { size } = device;

// Values passed into game props for current orientation
size.width;
size.height;

// The margins of the device
// Will be somewhere between 0 and the max values you set
size.widthMargin;
size.heightMargin;

// The width and height of the device itself in px
size.deviceWidth;
size.deviceHeight;
```

Here's how you could render a game's score at the top of the screen on all devices:

```js
  render({ props, device }) {
    const topY = device.size.height / 2 + device.size.heightMargin;
    return [
      t.text({
        text: `Score: ${props.score}`,
        font: { name: "Courier", size: 16 },
        color: "red",
        y: topY,
        anchorY: 8,
      }),
    ];
  },
```
